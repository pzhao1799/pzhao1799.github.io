<p class="message">
  Hi, I'm Peter, and I'm currently a student at Williams College studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm passionate about using technology and designing algorithms to solve global problems, and developing software that empowers minorities and disadvantaged populations.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
