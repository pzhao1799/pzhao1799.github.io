## Who I am
Again, I'm Peter Zhao, currently a student studying computer science and math, and hoping to make a difference in the world through software and tech. Born and raised in Northern Virginia, I was fortunate to have gone through an amazing school system with teachers and mentors who helped me get interested in **STEM**. I attended TJHSST in Alexandria, Virginia, which is a tech-focused magnet school, which is both where I became afraid of math, as well as fell in love with the ability of technology to influence almost every aspect of life. I'm interested in scalable systems, algorithmic problem solving & machine learning, blockchain technologies, and functional programming. I also care about teaching, educational equity, opportunities for FGLI students, startups, and culinary arts!
