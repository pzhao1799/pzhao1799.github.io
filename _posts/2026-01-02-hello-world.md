title: Hello World

Welcome to my blog! I'll be writing up my thoughts and explorations in my journey to learn more about all sorts of interesting topics.

Here's a code snippet to celebrate! Programmed in Python 3, and if you want to see what it does, just copy it into your favorite Python compiler!

```python
text = "Hello World"
excitement = 7

def celebrate(string, excite):
    for i in range(excite):
        string += "!"
    return string

print(celebrate(text,excitement))
```

Enjoy, and welcome!
