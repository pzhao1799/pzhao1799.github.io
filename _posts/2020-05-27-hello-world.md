title: Hello World
---

Welcome to my website! My first post shall be the classic Hello World program that programmers love to start as their first code they compile to make whenever they start learning a new programming language or other technological resource. This is my first attempt at making a personal website/blog, and I would like to thank [mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) for his great theme, as I myself have no talent in visual design, nor is it something I enjoy doing that much. I plan on using this to document projects I'm working on, movies/shows I've been watching (spoilers likely), as well as interesting things I see online.

Here's a code snippet to celebrate! Programmed in Python 3, and if you want to see what it does, just copy it into your favorite Python compiler!

``` python
text = "Hello World"
excitement = 7

def celebrate(string, excite):
    for i in range(excite):
        string += "!"
    return string

print(celebrate(text,excitement))
```

Enjoy, and welcome!
