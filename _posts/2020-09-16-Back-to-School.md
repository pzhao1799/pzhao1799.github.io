title: Back to School
---

After a long summer interning at JPMorgan Chase as a Software Engineering Intern, I was finally ready to head back to school. Despite the COVID pandemic, Williams was still able to stay open for students to study, albeit under strict guidelines. So far, the experience has been well, with weekly testing, lots of food options (living next to a dining hall really helps too), and fantastic dormmates to live with. This semester, I'm taking a tutorial on machine learning, a seminar on algorithmic game theory, and working with professor Sam McCauley on my thesis on algorithms and data structures. Should be a fun semester, especially since I'll have time to dive deep into topics I'm passionate about, and will be able to work on a couple of projects I've tossed on the backburner for awhile.
